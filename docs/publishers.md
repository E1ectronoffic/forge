# Publishers

Publishers are Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the
`make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or
use as updates.  This could be your update server or just an S3 bucket.

Each publisher has to be configured in the `publishers` section of your forge
configuration with which platforms to run for and the publisher specific config.
E.g.

```js
// forge.config.js
module.exports = {
  publishers: [
    {
      name: '@electron-forge/publisher-s3',
      platforms: ['darwin', 'linux'],
      config: {
        bucket: 'my-bucket',
        folder: 'my/key/prefix'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Please note that all publishers default to publishing all platforms, so you only
need to specify that key if you don't want that default.

Each built in publisher, where they send artifacts to and their config options
are documented below, there are also a number of
[community provided publisher targets](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=electron-forge-publisher).

{% method %}
## Electron Release Server

The Electron Release Server target publishes all your artifacts to a hosted
instance of [Electron Release Server](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server).

Please note that Electron Release Server is a community powered projects and is
not associated with Electron Forge or the Electron project directly.  It is
a handy way to quickly get an update server up and running though.

Configuration options are documented in [`PublisherERSConfig`](ref:///ts/publisher/electron-release-server/interfaces/publisherersconfig.html)

{% sample lang="javascript" %}
###### Usage
{%ace edit=false, lang='javascript', check=false, theme="tomorrow_night" %}

  config: {
    baseUrl: 'https://update.server.com',
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'admin'
  }
}
{%endace%}

{% endmethod %}

{% method %}
## GitHub

The GitHub target publishes all your artifacts to GitHub releases, this allows
you your users to download the files straight from your repository or you can
use [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org)
and get a free hosted update service.

{% sample lang="javascript" %}

    },
    prerelease: true
  }
}
{%endace%}

{% endmethod %}

{% method %}
## S3

The S3 target publishes all your artifacts to a S3 bucket, nothing fancy here,
literally just puts all your artifacts straight into the bucket.

By default all files are positioned at the following key:

`${config.folder || appVersion}/${artifactName}`

    public: true
  }
}
{%endace%}

{% endmethod %}

{% method %}
## Snapcraft

The Snapcraft target publishes just your `.snap` artifacts to the snap store.

This target requires the system has the `snapcraft` utility installed.
